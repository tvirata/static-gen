<h1>Background</h1>
<p>A static site generator (SSG) is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates. Essentially, a static site generator automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built, they can load very quickly in users' browsers.</p>
<p>SSG describes the process of compiling and rendering a website or app at build time. The output is a bunch of static files, including the HTML file itself and assets like JavaScript and CSS to be served entirely on the first load. These files can additionally be cached on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for even faster retrieval.</p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Install and start the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy static site generator</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell-session">npm install
npm start
</code></pre>
<p>Open the <a href="http://localhost:8080/">newly generated site</a>.</p>
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data (_data) supplied here for templating come from Pexels. Stock photos are widely used as visual elements in advertising and website design and Pexels is a website offering freely-usable stock photos through its curated collections of photos. If you want to generate your own Pexel photos, you'll need an API key in the <code>.env</code> file.</p>
